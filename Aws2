AWS STORAGE SERVICE
STORAGE OPTIONS INCLUDE
EBS
S3
EFS
SNOW BALL
STORAGE GATEWAY


STOARGE TYPES IN AWS
Block-Level(Basically binaries and software's can't modify or delete.)
EBS (Elastic Block Storage)-It requires mounting
A block storage (so you need to format it).This means you are able to choose which type of file system you want
It is really Fast
It is relatively cheap
With the new announcement From Amazon,You can store up to 16tb data per storage on SSD
You can snapshot an EBS (while it is still running) for backup reasons
You need an ec2 instance to attach it to
An Ebs volume cannot not be attached to more than one server.
Take an example of a labtop.Can a hard dive be mounted to two computers at a time?The answer is NO
Instance Stored Volumes

Object Level (Users/application related files ex.doc,images,pdf)

S3

For data to be stored in a server,we need a storage solution
We can mount a storage such as EBS to our server

How do you create and place resources in AWS:
    ec2 instances[webservers, dbServers, appServers]
    s3,
    efs  
    Load Balancers

meta data:This are datas about your instance.
Webserver = 
  Instance-id
  publicIP    

  /dev/xvda this is where a volume is mounted in a server


df -h
This shows the volume mounted on  your server
here you can see the percentage been used in your work

lsblk 
We can expand our volume with EBS(elastic block storage)

HOW TO ATTACH EBS VOLUME TO YOUR SERVER
1-make sure they are same availability zone
Take an example of a hard drive which is out of your home and your laptop in your home.
Will you be able to attach that hard drive to your laptop meanwhile the are not in the same locations?
the answer is NO
So its simple to connect your hard drive to your laptop the must be in the same place closer right.

So for Ebs Volume to connect with with your server the must be in same availability Zone.
e.g your server in us-east-1 and your Ebs volume must be in us-east-1 as well.
 PROCEDURES TO CREATE A VOLUME ON AWS
SELECT ON ELASTIC BLOCK STORAGE
CHOOSE VOLUME
CHOOSE CREATE VOLUME
VOLUME-TYPE-General purpose SSD(gp3)
SIze -CHoose any G example 6GB
Availability ZONE
Choose your availability Zone
TAG
KEY-Name value -Myvol
select Create
Now attach volume to your instance(when that is done you will see a volume state saying in use)

lsblk will show the mounted volumes
you will see the additioinal disk added

FORMAT AND MOUNT AN ATTACHED VOLUME

sudo file -s /dev/xvdf
This command will check if we have file sysytems
sudo mkfs -t xfs /dev/xvdf
this command will create a file system
sudo mkdir /data
this will create a mount point
ls /data 
you can see our mount point
df -h
check if your volume is mounted
sudo mount /dev/xvdf /data
this resource is mounted on /data
now do lsblk you will notice its mounted on /data
df -h
will show as you

Volume expansion - vertical   [4gb-->7gb] Vertical volume is when you increase your volume by space
Volume expansion - horizontal [v1=8g, v2=7g, v3=6g]  horizontal is whenn you create different storage and attach to your server

You can increase your EBS volume VERTICALLY by adding the GB.
click on volume
click on modify volume
SIZE-increase from maybe 4 to 8gb this is know as vertical expansion
A single server can have multiple EBS Volumes
