AWS STORAGE SERVICE
STOARGE TYPES IN AWS
Block-Level(Basically binaries and software's can't modify or delete.)
EBS (Elastic Block Storage)-It requires mounting
An Ebs volume cannot not be attached to more than one server.
Take an example of a labtop.Can a hard dive be mounted to two computers at a time?The answer is NO
Instance Stored Volumes

Object Level (Users/application related files ex.doc,images,pdf)

S3

For data to be stored in a server,we need a storage solution
We can mount a storage such as EBS to our server

How do you create and place resources in AWS:
    ec2 instances[webservers, dbServers, appServers]
    s3,
    efs  
    Load Balancers

meta data:This are datas about your instance.
Webserver = 
  Instance-id
  publicIP    

  /dev/xvda this is where a volume is mounted in a server


df -h
This shows the volume mounted on  your server
here you can see the percentage been used in your work

lsblk 
We can expand our volume with EBS(elastic block storage)

HOW TO ATTACH EBS VOLUME TO YOUR SERVER
1-make sure they are same availability zone
Take an example of a hard drive which is out of your home and your laptop in your home.
Will you be able to attach that hard drive to your laptop meanwhile the are not in the same locations?
the answer is NO
So its simple to connect your hard drive to your laptop the must be in the same place closer right.

So for Ebs Volume to connect with with your server the must be in same availability Zone.
e.g your server in us-east-1 and your Ebs volume must be in us-east-1 as well.
