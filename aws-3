What is SNAPSHOT IN AWS?
A snapshot is a base feature for creating backups of your EBS volume.A snapshot takes a copy of the ebs volume and places
it in Amazon S3 Where its stored redundantly in multiple Availability Zones.
Snapshot policy
Meaning you can program your system to do snapshot every 6am daily
these can be program according to your ticket given by your company
So you can use a snapshot life cycle policy

HOW TO CREATE A SNAPSHOT ON AWS

Click on the volume your working on
clcik on action and select create snapshot

also you can click on your EC2-instances that has a vloume
check the name and go back to volumes
and then you can create a snapshot from that volume
so e.g your jenkins server your click on the volume 
click action 
click create snapshot 
add a description e.g jenkins backup
add a tag NAME Value-sp-jenkins


So if you go to snapshot you will notice it has been created 
these snapshot is storted in and s3 bucket

ALso take note that for disaster recovery you should create your snapshot in different regions
e.g you create your snapshot in us-east-1b and another in us-west-2
Take note that you cannot use one ebs volume in two regions
but you can create a snapshot from that volume and use it to create and EBS Volume in another region
Those that makes sense now? YES
USING A SNAPSHOT TO CREATE A VOLUME IN ANOTHER REGION

HOW TO CREATE SNAPSHOT LIFECYCLE POLICY
go to volume
select the volume and click on create snapshot lifecycle policy
Target resource types-Volume
target resource tags
NAME 
SHedule details
choose schedule name
choose frequency e.g Daily
EVERY e.g 12 hours
Starting at e.g 9:00
Retention type e.g Count
Keep e.g 3

You can also enable Cross-Region copy to copy snapshots created by this 
schedule to up to three additional Regions
You can also enable cross-accountsharing to share the snapshots created by this schedule with other aws accounts

Now click on create
These process will Automatically create a snapshot for us.SO the automatic method is preferable than the manual process
to create a snapshot

How to create a volume from snapshot
just clcik on the snapshot 
click on action
create volume from snapshot
you can chnage the availability  zone
when you do this,you will notice that data found in your region can be found in another region
Take note you need to have enable cross region while creating the snapshot life cycle policy.

From a snapshot we can creAte images and volumes
Take an example you create a snapshot of your jenkins server and with the snapshot you create 
an image of that jenkins server which will include all of the stuffs found on your jenkins server right.
Example content of the jenkins will include OS/SOFTWARES/APPS AND EVERYTHING PART OF THE DOCKER

HOW TO CREATRE AN IMAGE FROM SNAPSHOT
select the snapshot and choose create image from snapshot
choose image name
add description
click create image
when its created you will notice that the image is available

YOU CAN USE THIS IMAGE TO CREATE AND INSTANCE
WHEN CREATING A SERVER YOU CAN USE MY-IMAGE

SO click on lunch instance
select instance name
select image and choose MYAMI
AND SELECT IT
This server will be created using your image

SOME FEW BENEFITS OF EBS VOLUME
Reliability  and secure storage
Secure
high performance
easy data backup
====================================================
EFS this stands for elastic file storage
Efs can be mounted on multiple instance
it is a network file system
Amazon Elastic file system (EFS) provides a simple scalable elastic file system for general
purpose workloads for use with aws cloud services and on-premises resources
Create Efs 
you can select default vpc or existing vpc

With efs data stored can synchronize in all the servers 
HOW TO ATTACH EFS 
Click on the efs created and select attach
now we can attach using NFS
make sure nfs port is open in the account your trying to mount the nfs
do same under security group of efs and allow all tcp ports open
Make sure nfs is installed in your system
Sudo yum install nfs-utils
sudo mkdir efs 
then copy the command on efs and tun on your cli
