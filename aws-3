What is SNAPSHOT IN AWS?
A snapshot is a base feature for creating backups of your EBS volume.A snapshot takes a copy of the ebs volume and places
it in Amazon S3 Where its stored redundantly in multiple Availability Zones.
Snapshot policy
Meaning you can program your system to do snapshot every 6am daily
these can be program according to your ticket given by your company
So you can use a snapshot life cycle policy

HOW TO CREATE A SNAPSHOT ON AWS

Click on the volume your working on
clcik on action and select create snapshot

also you can click on your EC2-instances that has a vloume
check the name and go back to volumes
and then you can create a snapshot from that volume
so e.g your jenkins server your click on the volume 
click action 
click create snapshot 
add a description e.g jenkins backup
add a tag NAME Value-sp-jenkins

So if you go to snapshot you will notice it has been created 
these snapshot is storted in and s3 bucket

ALso take note that for disaster recovery you should create your snapshot in different regions
e.g you create your snapshot in us-east-1b and another in us-west-2
Take note that you cannot use one ebs volume in two regions
but you can create a snapshot from that volume and use it to create and EBS Volume in another region
Those that makes sense now? YES
USING A SNAPSHOT TO CREATE A VOLUME IN ANOTHER REGION
