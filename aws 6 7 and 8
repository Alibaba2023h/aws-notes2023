CI-CD PIPELINE AND LOADBALANCER
===============================
When a developer push code to github,Devops engineers will pull the code on jenkins,
Next they will build the code using Maven.Packages will be built the ear/jar/ear
After packages are built with perform code quality analysis using SonarQube
After this stages is perform,We will deploy the artifact to nexus.Nexus is our artifactory repository
where by we store war,jar,ear packages.
After this 
We use Ansible for the application deployment
And we use tomcat as the app server 

So take NOTE Ansible is part of our pipeline

SO now there is a problem How will the 30 MILLION USERS ACCESS THE APPLICATION?

Take note we can't allow users to access the application directly on our web-server

So for that 30 USERS we need a LOADBALANCER that will route traffic between the 30users and App-server
So now take and example,what makes jenkins a jekins server because jenkins software has been install right
.What makes maven a maven server,because maven has been install right.
So what makes LOADBALANCER A loadbalancer server? its when nginx  or Apache has been installed in the Loadbalancer

if you allow users to access the application directly that will be vulnerable.
