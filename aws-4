S3 buckets
====================
What is S3 bucket?
An Amazon S3 bucket is a public cloud storage resource available in Amazon Web Services (AWS) Simple Storage Service (S3) platform.
It provides object-based storage, 
where data is stored inside S3 buckets in distinct units called objects instead of files.
SOME ADVANTAGES OF S3 BUCKETS
================================
-You can store files and folders but can't have locks,Permissions etc like you
would with a traditional file system
-This means by default yo can't just mount s3 and use it as your webserver
-But its perfect for storing your images and videos for your website
-great for short term achiving (e.g a few week). Its good for long term
archiving too but Glacier is more cost efficient
-Great for storing logs
-You can access the data from every region (extra costs may apply)
-Highly Available Redundant.Basically data loss is not possible
-Much cheaper than EBS
-You can serve the content directly to the internet.you can even have a full static
website working direct from s3 without an Ecs instance
Take note that aws provide us services

AWS Services classification:
==============================
  security  
  compute = 
     server - ec2 instances  
     serverless - Lambda / Beanstack / farget profile  this are servers but serverless
A serverless architecture is a way to build and run applications and services without having to manage infrastructure.
Your application still runs on servers, but all the server management is done by AWS
  Containers:
     ECS/ Amazon Elastic Container Service
     EKS/ Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service 

  databases 
  networking 
  data anylytics 

  storage  solutions:
    - Elastic Block Store          = block storage   
    - Elastic File system EFS / NFS= file storage This are network system managed by aws
You managed the nfs server and can be attached to many servers
If the server goes down there will be problems
All datas in your servers synchronize with the other server
our efs is hight scalable meaning the more you use it increase.It increase vertically
    - nfs port = 2049  

  ebs and efs required mounting

 1. create an s3 bucket and add objects without public access 
 2. create an s3 bucket with public access and add objects

Ticket002
 1. enable public access on the objects in your s3 bucket   

HOW TO CREATE S3 BUCKET
==========================

Go to aws 
select services
choose s3 bucket
select the bucket name
choose region
ACLs enabled
create
when this bucket is created
you can add any stuff in the s3 bucket from your system
That object wll have an object url

CREATE AND S3 BUCKET WITHOUT PUBLIC ACCESS
============================================
Follow the same stage we created the bucket above
under Block all public access
tick it so users can access it

CREATE AND S3 BUCKET WITH PUBLIC ACCESS  (if your creating s3 for a company with sensitive files then dont enable public access)
===========================================

Take note that you can assign permision to your s3 buckets
Grant read access to user in the internet or users

on your bucket you can change permission
object actions
you cam make a bucket public or private

Permissions in s3 are managed/granted using:
    1. Access Control List ACLs  
    2. Permissions [ALLOW PUBLIC]  

  S3 bucket = class32test   
     object in the s3 bucket = class33.jpg   


Permissions:
  Private access  
  public access [read/write]  

Policies:
  versioning   
  replication - You can replicate the object in a bucket in another bucket (the can be in the same region)
clcik on your bucket and choose versions
enable bucket versioning

you can also create another bucket and enable versioning while creating it

     class32test/class33.jpg  
     class32b/class33.jpg [The same/different region]         

Destination bucket:
 s3 bucket URL =   s3://class32b  

source bucket:
  s3://class32a  

Life Cycles Policies:
s3 storage classes: 
   Standard - frequent Access    = 0.5$/G/month  300
   IA (Infrequent Access)        = 0.3$/G/month  350  
   RRS                           = 0.2$/G/month  400 
   Glacier                       = 0.1$/G/month  500   
   deep Glacier [ 15 years   ]

s3 is a paid solution.
