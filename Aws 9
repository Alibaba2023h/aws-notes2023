  Remember we have two catergories for load balancer.
Network load-balancer and application load-balancer
Network load-balancer is layer7 and application-loadbalancer Layer7

For our customers to access the Application with need to create Hosted zones using A-record
So firstly you need to buy a domain name
Examples of Domain names/Lavet.com Benjamincompany.com

So AWS Has a DNA service called route 53 used to route traffic.
SO WHAT IS ROUTE53?
======================
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable cloud domain name system (DNS) service.
Enables to customize DNS routing policies to reduce latency.
What is Route 53 used for?
Amazon Route 53 is a highly available and scalable Domain Name System (DNS) web service. 
You can use Route 53 to perform three main functions in any combination:
domain registration, DNS routing, and health checking. Your website needs a name, such as example.com.

SO you need to buy a domain first.Click on Registered Domain if you have one already.
Now you can click on your domain name and create A-records
We want a suitation where by users will type just our name and access our application instead of 
typing the loadbalancer URL.
